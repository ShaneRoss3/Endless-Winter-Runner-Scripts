Endless Winter Running Game Scripts

•	  Developed an endless runner game in Unity using C# with a winter themed environment and procedural 
level generation 

• Implemented player movement, obstacle avoidance, and collectable ornaments as the primary scoring 
mechanism. 

• Designed a system for procedural terrain generation, adding new sections every 4 seconds for infinite 
gameplay.

Netlify for accessibility.
